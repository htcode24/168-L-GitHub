<h2>Snail Mail Envelope Tutorial</h2>
<p> Hello! My name is Hillary, and one of my <strong>favorite</strong> hobbies is to illustrate and write letters to my closest friends and family aka sending snail mail! Nowadays, the most common form of communication is texting by sending a message to someone's phone number or their social media inbox. To send a written letter to someone, what information do you need to provide? And where does it go on the envelope itself? I'll walk you through the steps to begin and send a snail mail letter. </p>

<h3> To start a snail mail letter, you will need: </h3>
<p>
- 1 sheet of 8.5x11 cardstock paper <br>
- 3 sheets of college-ruled paper <br>
- 1 pair of scissors <br>
- 1 roll of double-sided tape <br>
- 1 pen with black ink <br>
- 1 writing medium of choice with legible ink <br>
- 1-3 Postage Stamps (depending on the weight of your envelope)
</p>

<h3> Assembling your envelope </h3>
<p>
- Place the 8.5x11 paper on the desk in front of you with the short side of the paper facing towards you. <br>
- Holding the bottom two corners, pull them up to the top leaving half an inch of space before touching the top two corners. <br>
- Firmly crease the bottom portion once folded. <br>
- Open the paper so that it faces you again and rotate it so now the long side of the paper is facing you. <br>
- Holding the bottom two corners, fold up half an inch of paper and crease the edges. <br>
- Rotate the paper 180 degrees and repeat the last step. <br>
- Open the paper again so it is completely flat. <br>
- Using your scissors, cut out the two corner rectangles with the smallest area. <br>
- Once the corners are cut, orient the paper so that the center flap is closest to you but when folded down, faces you then down a 180 degree fold away. <br>
- Grab the double sided tape roll and glide it across on the full edge of the center flap you will be using to seal the envelope. <br> 
  - When you get the full edge taped, cut off the excess. Don't remove the tape backing yet. <br>
- Again with the tape, glide it across the edge of both side flaps, and cut off the excess. <br>
- Remote the tape backing of both side flaps and press down to secure. <br>
- Set aside for now.
</p>

  
<h3> Writing the letter </h3>
<p>
- Grab your sheets of college-ruled paper and your preferred writing medium with the color of choice. <br>
(<em>My go-to writing tool is bright red, blue, green, yellow, orange colored pencils!</em>) <br>
- At the top right, write the current date and time. <br>
- At the top left, write, "Dear" followed by the name of the person you are addressing the letter to. <br>
- Write what comes to mind first and the rest of your writing will flow after.
</p>

<h3> Addressing the envelope </h3>
<p>
- The top left corner is where your name and full mailing address is written in the scenario that it need to return to you because the wrong delivery address was written, it was damaged, etc. <br>
- The center of the envelope is where the name of the intended recipient and their full mailing address is written. <br>
- The top right corner is intended for stamps that paid for postage to deliver your letter. Usually, if you're sending a light weight letter, a forever stamp is enough postage. **Note**: Check with your local postal office for stamp rates. <br>
It's very important the writing is written clearly for the postal office to be able to read. I recommend a black ballpoint pen with dark ink.
</p>

<h3> Finishing the envelope </h3>
<p>
Once you've finished writing the letter and you've addressed the envelope: <br>
- Fold the letter into halves and/or quarters and place in the envelope you made. <br>
- Add any additional stationery you'd like that can sit flatly in the envelope: <br>
  - Examples includes stickers, sticky notes, limited edition washi tape, etc. <br>
- When all intended items are in the envelope, remove the tape backing on the center flap and press down to close and seal shut the envelope. <br>
- Drop off the addressed envelope into any postage drop off box or being it into a postal office for the front desk employee to weigh of the postage paid is enough. <br>
